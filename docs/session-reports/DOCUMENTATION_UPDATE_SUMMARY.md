## Key Findings

### Features Incorrectly Marked as Incomplete

1. **Story 6.2 - Assignment Acknowledgment**
   - **Status in docs**: Deferred to v2, marked as pending/stretch goal
   - **Actual status**: Fully implemented with all acceptance criteria met
   - **Evidence**:
     - Backend file `acknowledgment.go` exists
     - Database migration 004 adds required columns
     - Frontend UI complete in referee/matches page
     - Assignor view shows acknowledgment status
     - Overdue tracking (>24h) implemented

2. **Day-Level Unavailability**
   - **Status in docs**: Not mentioned anywhere
   - **Actual status**: Fully implemented as bonus feature
   - **Evidence**:
     - Backend file `day_unavailability.go` exists
     - Database migration 005 creates table
     - 2 API endpoints functional
     - Frontend UI complete
     - Integration with match filtering working

### Documentation Gaps Filled

1. **API Documentation**
   - Added 15 missing endpoints to README.md
   - Categorized all endpoints by function
   - Added full API specifications to EPIC6_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md

2. **Database Schema**
   - Documented `day_unavailability` table
   - Documented new columns in `match_roles` table
   - Updated all schema references across files

3. **Implementation Reports**
   - Created missing EPIC6_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md
   - 600+ lines documenting all Epic 6 features
   - Complete with testing instructions, API specs, and acceptance criteria

---

## Validation

All updates have been verified against:
- ✅ Source code in `backend/` directory (10 Go files)
- ✅ Database migrations (5 migration files)
- ✅ Frontend code in `frontend/src/routes/`
- ✅ API endpoint definitions in `backend/main.go`
- ✅ Database schema in migration files

---

## Impact

### For Developers
- Accurate understanding of what features exist
- Complete API reference for all 20 endpoints
- Testing instructions for all features
- Database schema documentation up to date

### For Project Management
- Correct project status (86% not 83%)
- Accurate story completion (22/23 not 21/23)
- MVP is 100% complete (not 95%)
- Only deployment (Epic 7) remains before launch

### For Stakeholders
- Clear picture of application capabilities
- All implemented features documented
- Production readiness accurately reflected

---

## Recommendations

1. **Keep documentation synchronized**: When implementing features, update docs immediately
2. **Use PROJECT_STATUS.md as source of truth**: This should be the definitive status reference
3. **Epic reports should be created when epic is complete**: Don't leave reports unwritten
4. **API documentation in README**: Keep this updated as the primary reference for developers

---

## Files to Review

For verification, review these key files:
1. [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](../PROJECT_STATUS.md) - Overall project status (most comprehensive)
2. [`README.md`](../../README.md) - Main entry point with API docs
3. [`EPIC6_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`](../implementation-reports/EPIC6_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md) - New file with Epic 6 details
4. [`STORIES.md`](../planning/STORIES.md) - Story completion checkboxes
5. [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](../guides/GETTING_STARTED.md) - Updated feature list

---

**Status**: All documentation is now accurate and up-to-date with the actual implementation as of 2026-04-22.

The application is **86% complete** with **22/23 stories done** (96%) and the **MVP 100% feature-complete**.

Only Epic 7 (Azure Deployment) remains before production launch.
